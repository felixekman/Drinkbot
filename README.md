A newbies attempt at controlling a bunch of peristaltic pumps

I have ordered 8 Peristaltic Pumps. 12VDC 200-300mA
  https://www.adafruit.com/products/1150

I hope to drive them via a Raspberry Pi Model B.
I want to be able to control the pumps individually with Mosfets for ON/OFF operation (Possibly via PWM) from the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. I hope to connect the pumps via RJ45 connectors for easy connect and disconnect. I want to drive the entire system from a single 12V power supply.
My current plan is to build my own PCB (first time ever so I need a little help) using these components and ordering the PCB from OSHPark.

Components for the build:

1 pcs Raspberry Pi Model B

8 pcs Peristaltic Pumps. 12VDC 200-300mA (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1150)

8 pcs RJ45 8-Pin connectors (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/643)

8 pcs N-Channel MOSFET 60V 30A FQP30N06L (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10213)

8 pcs 10k Ohm 1/4th W Resistors (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8374)

8 pcs 1N4007 Diode MIC DO-41 1A 1000V Rectifier Diode

1 pcs Voltage Regulator - 5V L7805 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/107)

1 pcs Raspberry Pi - GPIO Shrouded Header (2x13)
